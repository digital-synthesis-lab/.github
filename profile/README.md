# Digital Synthesis Lab @ UCLA

We develop computational methods to enable predictive materials synthesis, thus accelerating their design beyond screening. 
Using a range of tools - from databases to machine learning - we propose solutions in energy, sustainability, and AI.
Our group is based in the [Department of Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.ucla.edu) at UCLA.
Learn more about our research at [our website](https://dskoda.com).

## Our projects

Some of our current projects include:

 - [mkite](https://github.com/mkite-group): a platform for high-throughput materials simulations in distributed computing.
